# cred@ Attribution System

ATTN: these are initial thought aboout the cred@ system; this is intended as a very rough draft. Thoughts and comments and feature ideas are welcome. Feel free to join this repo and create issues with your ideas.

## Overview

cred@ is an open, distributed attribution system designed to create verifiable chains of intellectual credit across platforms and mediums. It provides:
- Universal syntax for attribution
- Verifiable credit chains
- Automated tracking
- Distributed verification
- Platform independence

The system allows both passive tracking of attribution and active user engagement, while remaining platform-agnostic and open source.

## Basic Syntax

Core required elements:
```
cred@system:resource:unique_id
```

Full syntax with optionals:
```
[creditor]@cred@system:resource:id[:user][:temporal]
```

- `system`: The platform/source (arxiv, github, etc.)
- `resource`: Type of thing being credited (paper, repo, tweet, etc.)
- `id`: Unique identifier within that system
- `user`: Optional specific attribution (defaults to all contributors)
- `temporal`: Optional version/time reference (defaults to latest)

## System Examples

### Academic Papers
```
# Basic paper citation
cred@arxiv:paper:2311.12345

# Specific version/author
cred@arxiv:paper:2311.12345:hinton:v2

# DOI reference
cred@doi:paper:10.1038/nature12345
```

### Code/Software
```
# Repository
cred@github:repo:user/project

# Specific file
cred@github:file:user/repo/path/file.py

# Specific commit
cred@github:repo:project:user:commit-a1b2c3
```

### Social Media
```
# Tweet reference
cred@x:tweet:123456

# Blog post
cred@medium:post:user/post-id

# Video content
cred@youtube:video:video-id:timestamp
```

### Art/Creative Works
```
# Digital art
cred@opensea:artwork:token-id

# Music
cred@spotify:track:track-id

# Photography
cred@flickr:photo:photo-id
```

## Use Cases

### Passive Attribution
- Automatic citation tracking
- Work preservation
- Attribution chain mapping
- Timestamp verification

### Active User Features
- Identity unification across platforms
- Attribution "inbox" at cred.at/receive/username
- Credit visualization
- Impact metrics
- Connection graphs

### Tool Integration
- Document editor integration
- Citation management
- Rich web previews
- Development tool tracking
- AI/ML attribution

### AI/ML Applications
- Training data attribution
- Source verification
- Hallucination reduction
- Knowledge graphing
- Fact checking

## Distributed System Architecture

### Core Components
1. Open Protocol
   - Standard specification
   - Reference implementation
   - API definitions
   - Verification methods

2. Node Types
   - Full nodes (complete data)
   - Light nodes (recent data)
   - Archive nodes (historical)
   - Verification nodes

3. Data Distribution
   - Peer-to-peer sync
   - Merkle tree verification
   - Multiple redundant storage
   - Decentralized consensus

### Implementation Approach
1. Initial Phase
   - Central cred.at service
   - Basic API and tools
   - Reference implementations
   - Early adopter integration

2. Decentralization
   - Multiple independent nodes
   - Distributed verification
   - Community governance
   - Open source tools

3. Ecosystem Growth
   - Third-party implementations
   - Tool integration
   - AI/ML adoption
   - Standard establishment

## Future Development

### Priority Areas
1. Core Protocol Development
2. Reference Implementation
3. API Standards
4. Verification Systems
5. Tool Integration

### Community Goals
